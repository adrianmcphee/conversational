# Technology Evaluation Framework for Trust Layer Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our approach to evaluating technology options for implementing the Trust Layer pattern. Rather than defaulting to any specific framework, we will systematically evaluate multiple approaches based on clear criteria aligned with our goals.

---

## Core Principle

**The Trust Layer is a pattern, not a technology choice.** We can implement programmatic supervision of LLMs using various approaches - the key is choosing the one that best balances control, complexity, and speed to market.

---

## Technology Options to Evaluate

### Option 1: Pure Cloud Services Approach
**Stack**: Azure OpenAI + Azure Functions + Custom Python

**Architecture**:
```python
# Direct implementation of Trust Layer classes
class TrustLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.input_processor = InputProcessor()
        self.llm_client = AzureOpenAI()
        self.guards = GuardSystem()
        
    async def process(self, user_input):
        # Our control logic, not framework's
        processed = await self.input_processor.process(user_input)
        if processed.risk_level == "HIGH":
            return self.deterministic_handler(processed)
        # ... rest of Trust Layer logic
```

**Pros**:
- Maximum control over every line of code
- No framework overhead or constraints
- Cloud-native from day one
- Easy to understand and modify
- Fast iteration cycles

**Cons**:
- Need to build routing and state management
- More initial development work
- Less community resources

---

### Option 2: Lightweight Orchestration
**Stack**: LangChain/Semantic Kernel + Azure OpenAI

**Architecture**:
```python
# Using LangChain as a thin orchestration layer
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain

class TrustLayerChain:
    def __init__(self):
        # We still control the flow
        self.input_processor = InputProcessor()
        self.chain = self.build_constrained_chain()
        self.guards = GuardSystem()
        
    def build_constrained_chain(self):
        # Use LangChain for what it's good at
        template = PromptTemplate(...)
        return LLMChain(llm=AzureOpenAI(), template=template)
```

**Pros**:
- Helpful abstractions for prompt management
- Built-in memory and conversation handling
- Good ecosystem of tools
- Still maintain control over core logic

**Cons**:
- Additional dependency
- Some learning curve
- Potential for framework lock-in

---

### Option 3: Traditional Conversational Framework
**Stack**: Rasa/Dialogflow + Custom Extensions

**Architecture**:
```yaml
# Rasa configuration with Trust Layer extensions
intents:
  - transfer_money
  - check_balance

actions:
  - action_trust_layer_process  # Our custom Trust Layer
```

**Pros**:
- Mature intent/entity recognition
- Built-in dialogue management
- Training UI and tools
- Enterprise adoption proven

**Cons**:
- Heavy framework with opinions
- Requires significant setup
- May fight framework for control
- Deployment complexity

---

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach
**Stack**: Azure Cognitive Services for NLU + Custom Trust Layer + Multiple LLMs

**Architecture**:
```python
class HybridTrustLayer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Use best tool for each job
        self.nlu = AzureCognitiveServices()  # Intent classification
        self.input_processor = InputProcessor()  # Our PII logic
        self.llm_router = LLMRouter()  # Our multi-provider logic
        self.guards = GuardSystem()  # Our validation
```

**Pros**:
- Best of breed for each component
- No single point of failure
- Maximum flexibility
- Cloud-native services

**Cons**:
- Multiple services to manage
- Potential latency from service calls
- More complex monitoring

## Decision Framework

### Must-Have Requirements
✓ Implement Trust Layer pattern without compromise  
✓ Support multiple LLM providers  
✓ Sub-100ms guard execution  
✓ Complete audit trail capability  
✓ Azure-native deployment  

### Nice-to-Have Features
- Pre-built intent classifiers
- Conversation management
- Visual dialogue builders
- Community extensions

### Red Flags That Disqualify an Option
❌ Cannot implement custom validation logic  
❌ Forces specific LLM provider  
❌ Requires on-premises deployment  
❌ No programmatic control over responses  
❌ Closed-source critical components  

---

## Recommendation Process

1. **Build Prototypes** (Week 1)
   - Implement core Trust Layer in each approach
   - Measure actual development time
   - Test critical scenarios

2. **Benchmark Performance** (Week 2)
   - Response latency
   - Guard execution time
   - Scalability testing

3. **Assess Maintainability**
   - Code complexity
   - Testing approach
   - Debugging capability

4. **Calculate TCO**
   - Development effort
   - Infrastructure costs
   - Ongoing maintenance

5. **Make Decision**
   - Score against criteria
   - Document rationale
   - Create migration plan if needed

---

## Expected Outcome

Based on the Trust Layer pattern requirements and cloud-native preference, we expect the evaluation to favor either:

1. **Pure Cloud Services** - If control and simplicity outweigh development effort
2. **Hybrid Approach** - If we want best-of-breed components with full control

However, we remain open to any approach that best serves our goals. The key is that **we control the Trust Layer logic**, regardless of what tools we use underneath.

---

## Next Steps

1. Allocate 2-week sprint for technology evaluation
2. Assign 2 senior engineers to build prototypes
3. Define specific test scenarios for comparison
4. Schedule decision checkpoint with stakeholders
5. Document Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

The Trust Layer pattern is our innovation - the technology choice is simply how we implement it most effectively.
