# Unified Vision: Safe Conversational Banking with LLMs

## Executive Summary

This document presents a unified vision for building a conversational banking system that safely harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining the control, compliance, and trust that banking requires. The approach focuses on implementing a **Trust Layer** - programmatic supervision and control mechanisms around LLMs - rather than relying on any specific conversational framework.

**Core Principle**: Treat LLMs as brilliant but unreliable consultants requiring constant supervision, not as decision-makers. The Trust Layer implements this supervision through code, not through framework choice.

## 1. Vision Statement

**To prove that LLMs can be safely deployed in banking through a multi-layered architecture that combines LLM creativity with banking-grade guardrails, enabling rapid implementation while maintaining demonstrable control and regulatory compliance.**

## 2. Strategic Goals

### 2.1 Primary Objectives
- **Safety First**: Demonstrate zero-tolerance for financial harm through multiple validation layers
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet all major jurisdictional requirements (EU, UK, US, Global)
- **Rapid Proof-of-Value**: Build working system in 90 days to prove feasibility
- **Scalable Foundation**: Create architecture that scales from pilot to production
- **Evidence Generation**: Produce comprehensive audit trails and performance metrics

### 2.2 Success Metrics
- **Safety**: 0% unauthorized financial actions, <0.1% compliance violations
- **Performance**: >95% intent accuracy, <2 second response time
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with graceful degradation
- **Compliance**: 100% auditability, complete regulatory mapping
- **User Experience**: >85% task completion rate, >4.0/5.0 satisfaction

## 3. Unified Architecture Strategy

### 3.1 The Trust Layer Foundation
Building on the "Trust Layer" concept, we treat LLMs as powerful but supervised components:

```
User Input → Trust Layer → Response Generation → Multi-Guard Validation → User Response
```

**Key Components:**
- **Input Sanitization**: PII masking, intent classification, risk scoring
- **Routing Logic**: Direct high-risk queries to deterministic flows
- **Constrained Generation**: Template-bound LLM responses with multiple validation attempts
- **Multi-Layer Validation**: Regex, PII, compliance, and LLM safety guards
- **Action Authorization**: LLMs suggest, never execute financial operations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete traceability for regulatory requirements

### 3.2 Cloud-Native Trust Layer Implementation
Build programmatic control layers around LLMs using modern cloud services with workspace-based deployment:

**Control Layer** (Custom Python Services):
- InputProcessor class for PII masking and risk routing
- ConstrainedLLM class for template-bound generation
- ResponseValidator with multiple validation checks
- ActionAuthorizer ensuring LLMs never execute operations
- All implemented as microservices or serverless functions

**Workspace Isolation Architecture**:
- Each configuration runs in isolated workspace (PostgreSQL schema)
- Enable parallel testing of different models/configurations
- Support canary deployments with gradual traffic routing
- Instant rollback by redirecting traffic between workspaces
- Complete audit trail per workspace for compliance

**Intelligence Layer** (Multi-Provider LLM Strategy):
- Azure OpenAI Service with content filters
- Anthropic Claude via API for comparison
- Google Vertex AI as fallback option
- Local models (Llama) for sensitive operations if needed
- Adapter pattern for provider independence

**Safety Layer** (Programmatic Guards):
- Fast regex validators (Python functions)
- Azure Content Safety API for toxicity
- Custom compliance rule engines
- LLM-based safety validation
- All guards run in parallel with fail-fast logic

**Infrastructure** (Cloud-Native on Azure):
- Azure Functions for serverless guard execution
- Azure Container Instances for microservices
- Azure Cognitive Services for intent classification
- Azure Monitor for comprehensive observability
- Azure Key Vault for secrets management

### 3.3 Model Stacking Strategy
Following regulatory best practices for model risk management:

**Tier 1 (High-Risk Operations)**: Transfer requests, fraud reports, disputes
- 3-5 validation models in parallel processing
- Cascade validation with human escalation
- Enhanced audit requirements

**Tier 2 (Medium-Risk)**: Account inquiries, card management
- 2-3 models with champion-challenger approach
- Ensemble voting for final decisions
- Quarterly drift monitoring

**Tier 3 (Low-Risk)**: General inquiries, help requests
- Single model with human review fallback
- Lightweight validation with annual audits

## Conclusion

This unified vision provides a practical, safety-first approach to deploying LLMs in banking. By combining the control and auditability of traditional conversational AI frameworks with the power and flexibility of modern LLMs, we can prove that AI can be both innovative and safe in financial services.

The key to success is treating LLMs as powerful tools requiring constant supervision rather than autonomous decision-makers. Through layered defenses, comprehensive testing, and complete auditability, we can demonstrate that conversational AI can enhance banking services while maintaining the trust and compliance that the industry requires.

The 90-day implementation plan provides a rapid path to proof-of-value while building the foundation for long-term success. By focusing on evidence generation and demonstrable control, this approach positions organizations to confidently adopt AI while satisfying the most stringent regulatory requirements.
