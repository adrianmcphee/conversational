Synthetic Data Strategy for Conversational Banking Testing
1. Core Dataset Categories
A. Intent & Entity Recognition Data
Banking-Specific Intents (20+ categories)
* Account inquiries (balance, history, statements)
* Transfer operations (domestic, international, P2P)
* Card management (activate, block, PIN reset, limits)
* Loan inquiries (rates, applications, payments)
* Investment services (portfolio, trading, advice)
* Dispute & fraud (transaction disputes, card theft)
* Authentication flows (login, OTP, security questions)
* Customer service (appointments, contact info, complaints)
Entity Variations per Intent
* Account types: checking, savings, credit, investment, mortgage
* Amounts: various currencies, formats (€1,000 vs €1000 vs 1k euros)
* Dates: relative (yesterday, last month) vs absolute (March 15th)
* Recipients: names, IBANs, phone numbers, account nicknames
B. Multi-Turn Conversation Flows
Complete Transaction Scenarios
User: "I want to transfer money"
Bot: "I can help with that. What amount would you like to transfer?"
User: "500 euros"
Bot: "From which account?"
User: "My savings"
Bot: "And to which account or recipient?"
User: "My checking account"
Bot: "To confirm: Transfer €500 from Savings to Checking. Please enter your OTP."
Interruption & Context Switch Scenarios
User: "Transfer 200 to my checking"
Bot: "From which account would you like to transfer?"
User: "Actually, first show me my balance"
Bot: "Your current balances are: Savings: €2,450, Checking: €890. Would you like to continue with the transfer?"
C. Multilingual Variations
Language-Specific Patterns
* Formal vs informal address (German Sie/Du, Spanish Usted/Tú)
* Currency formats by locale (€1.234,56 vs €1,234.56)
* Date formats (DD/MM/YYYY vs MM/DD/YYYY)
* Cultural banking terminology differences
D. Edge Cases & Error Scenarios
System Limitations
* Insufficient funds scenarios
* Maintenance windows ("Sorry, transfers are temporarily unavailable")
* Daily/monthly limits exceeded
* Suspicious activity triggers
User Input Variations
* Typos and misspellings ("ballance", "tranfer")
* Ambiguous requests ("send money to John" - multiple Johns)
* Incomplete information ("transfer some money")
* Out-of-scope requests ("What's the weather?")

2. Expected Outcome Framework
A. Intent Classification Accuracy
{
  "input": "What's my checking account balance?",
  "expected_intent": "account_balance_inquiry",
  "expected_entities": {
    "account_type": "checking"
  },
  "confidence_threshold": 0.85
}
B. Dialogue Flow Validation
{
  "conversation_id": "transfer_basic_001",
  "turns": [
    {
      "user_input": "Transfer 500 euros",
      "expected_action": "request_source_account",
      "expected_slots": {"amount": 500, "currency": "EUR"}
    },
    {
      "user_input": "From savings",
      "expected_action": "request_destination_account",
      "expected_slots": {"source_account": "savings"}
    }
  ],
  "expected_final_state": "ready_for_authentication"
}

C. Compliance Validation
{
  "scenario": "high_value_transfer",
  "input": "Send €15,000 to my friend",
  "expected_compliance_triggers": [
    "enhanced_due_diligence_required",
    "aml_screening_needed",
    "manager_approval_required"
  ],
  "expected_disclosures": [
    "large_transfer_warning",
    "fraud_prevention_notice"
  ]
}
D. LLM Response Quality Metrics
{
  "input": "Why was my card declined?",
  "expected_response_criteria": {
    "mentions_common_causes": true,
    "suggests_next_steps": true,
    "maintains_professional_tone": true,
    "avoids_speculation": true,
    "includes_contact_option": true
  },
  "prohibited_content": [
    "specific_account_details_without_auth",
    "definitive_diagnosis_without_data"
  ]
}

3. Data Generation Strategy
A. Template-Based Generation
Intent Templates with Variations
transfer_templates = [
    "Transfer {amount} from {source} to {destination}",
    "Send {amount} to {destination}",
    "Move {amount} from my {source} account",
    "I want to transfer {amount}",
    "Can you help me send {amount}?"
]


# Generate variations
amounts = ["€500", "500 euros", "five hundred", "€500.00"]
sources = ["savings", "checking", "my savings account"]
destinations = ["checking", "John Smith", "IBAN DE89370400440532013000"]
B. LLM-Assisted Generation
Prompt for Realistic Variations
Generate 50 different ways a customer might ask about their account balance, including:
- Formal and informal language
- Different account types
- Various time periods
- Common typos and colloquialisms
- Multiple languages (English, German, Spanish, Dutch)
